# SMS Spam Detection
![sms](assets/sms_header.jpg)

<!--This project implements an SMS spam detection system using machine learning techniques. The core logic and experiments are documented in `model.ipynb`.-->
<!--
## Overview

Engineered a machine learning workflow to detect and classify sms messages as ham or spam. The workflow includes data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and prediction.-->


## Procedures
-   Import Libraries
    - pandas
    - scikit-learn
    - seaborn
    - matplotlib
    - numpy

- Data Loading

<a href="/data/spam.csv">Check out dataset</a>

| v1  | v2 |
|-----|-----|
| ham | Go until jurong point, crazy.. Available only ... |
| ham | Ok lar... Joking wif u oni... |
| spam | Free entry in 2 a wkly comp to win FA Cup fina... |
| ham | U dun say so early hor... U c already then say... |
| ham | Nah I don't think he goes to usf, he lives aro... |


- Data Preprocessing
    - Rename columns for clarity
    - Check for missing values
    - Check for duplicated rows

- Data Encoding
    - Initialize LabelEncoder to categorical text labels to numerical values


- Feature Engineering
    - Feature (X): ``df["message"] ``

    - Target (y): ``df["label_encoded"] ``

- Data Splitting

- Pre-Training Visualization

- Model Training and Comparison
    - Multinominal Naive Bayes
    - Random Forest
    - Logistic Regression

<!--
- Import Libraries

-   Data Loading

- The dataset is loaded (typically a CSV file with columns like `label` and `message`).
- Labels are mapped to binary values (e.g., "spam" = 1, "ham" = 0).

#### 2. Data Preprocessing

- Text cleaning: Lowercasing, removing punctuation, and stopwords.
- Tokenization: Splitting messages into words.
- Optional: Stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.

#### 3. Feature Extraction

- Text data is converted into numerical features using techniques like:
    - Bag of Words (CountVectorizer)
    - TF-IDF (TfidfVectorizer)

#### 4. Model Training

- The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
- Machine learning models are trained, such as:
    - Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
    - Logistic Regression
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Hyperparameters may be tuned for better performance.

#### 5. Evaluation

- Models are evaluated using metrics like:
    - Accuracy
    - Precision
    - Recall
    - F1-score
    - Confusion matrix

#### 6. Prediction

- The trained model predicts whether new messages are spam or ham.
